# ML-Tutorial
1st ML Project

This is a ML project to to practise Python and learn machines learning and practise some of the ML techniques. Objectve is to learn in a more practical route(application based).

I am using a housing data got form Kaggle, where we have a predictor as Sale Price, and about 100 variables as inputs(house build data, number of rooms, sq ft, number fo floors, quality of the house). Basically we have continous, categorical, likert scale data and count data.

Steps to follow:

1) Import data sets
2) Explore data

-Understanding features- possiblly historgrams
Correlation- to see if all variables are actually important, and should we consider these different variables for the analysis.

-Columns with missing value
 Imputation
 Continous data- Mean, Median, we could later explore more difficult methods
 Categorical data- One hot encoding
 
 Model Building

 Split data to test and train data(80-20).
 
 Try random forest - Hyper paramter tuning
 XG Boost-  Hyper parameter tuning
 
 Using Piple Line for K-fold cross valdidation
 - Did a 10 fold cross vailidation
